# 👋 Hi, I'm Ashesh Bajracharya 
Aspiring AI/ML Engineer | Cloud & DevOps Enthusiast

### 🚀 About Me

I'm a Computer Science student passionate about **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Cloud Computing**. I’ve completed AI/ML bootcamps and built multiple hands-on projects using tools like `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`, `Flask`, and `React.js`. I'm especially excited by the potential of **Generative AI** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to shape the future of tech.
